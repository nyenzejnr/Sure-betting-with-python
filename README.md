A ‘bet’ is an agreement between two parties. The party that makes an incorrect prediction forfeits something stipulated to the other. When you place a bet, you predict an outcome at predefined odds. The traditional form of betting involves the bookmaker against the punter, but the Betfair Exchange, and others like it, have changed the game completely.
It is the practice of finding a bet at odds that give you the ‘edge’ over the bookmaker. If there is a much better chance of an event occurring than what the bookie’s odds say, you have a ‘value’ bet.
